				<h2>How to play</h2>
				Welcome to my innovative new game. Your goal is to guess all 11881376 hidden words.
				Use your keyboard to type in your guess and press enter to submit it.
				You will get some information about the hidden word based on your guess.
				A green colored letter indicates that the letter you guessed is in the correct position.
				A yellow colored letter indicates that the letter you guessed occurs within the hidden word,
				but not in the position in which you guessed. If a letter occurs multiple times within a single
				word, the procedure for determining the color of a guessed letter is thus:
				<ol>
					<li>Count the number of occurrences of a given letter.</li>
					<li>Color each occurrence of the letter for which your guess was in the correct position and color them green. Keep track of this number of green colored letters, which is independent for each distinct letter.</li>
					<li>For each occurrence of the letter that is not colored green, go from left to right. The number of letters that will be colored yellow is the maximum of the number of remaining occurrences of this letter in the guess and the number of total occurrences of the letter in the hidden word minus the number of letters colored green.</li>
				</ol>
				These rules apply to all the hidden words, some of which are displayed on the screen at a time. You may paginate using the buttons on the bottom of the screen. The objective of the game is to solve all the hidden words.
				<br>
				There are two modes in this game, the featured game and free play. The featured game gives you a set of words that changes every 11881376 milliseconds. Click <button id="featured-game-button">here</button> to play the current featured game, resetting your current progress.
				<br>
				Free play generates a random set of words every time you play it. Click <button id="free-play-button">here</button> to enter free play, resetting your current progress.
				<h2>Feedback</h2>
				Questions, comments, and suggestions are appreciated. Open an issue on GitHub or just directly talk to me if there's anything you want to say. This is the only way I can tell if anyone cares since I don't have any analytics set up.
				I will add a FAQ section if there is anything applicable.
