<div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="1">1</div><h1 class="prose"># Welcome to my new blog<br><br></h1><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="2">2</div><p class="prose">I've been meaning to make a blog for quite a while, but its been very difficult for me to get started. There is nothing technically challenging about starting a blog, but I've struggled to come up with a design I like.<br><br></p><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="3">3</div><h2 class="prose">## Motivation and frustrations<br><br></h2><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="4">4</div><p class="prose">I knew from the outset that I want to base my design around monospaced text. Monospace brings with it such nice properties that it's baffling to me how eager designers are to reject it in anything meant to be seen by non-programmers.<br><br></p><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="5">5</div><p class="prose">I quite enjoy the rigid organization in terminal user interfaces, and there are sites and tools that bring the style of the terminal to the browser. <a href="https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> is a fun example, with many HTML elements reimagined in a terminal style. However, I want my own site to take greater advantage of HTML's strengths rather than try to merely imitate the terminal.<br><br></p><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="6">6</div><h2 class="prose">## Rationale for the current design or: How I spent hours writing 444 bytes of CSS<br><br></h2><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="7">7</div><p class="prose">I started off with white text on a black background because it's comfortable, readable, and simple. I chose Courier New because I don't want to force anyone to download a font and it doesn't matter for this blog if non-ASCII characters look 亂七八糟.<br><br></p><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="8">8</div><p class="prose">I then experimented with the finer details of the layout. My original goal was to guarantee that the text would display on a perfect grid on any system, but I realized that would require cluttering the HTML with a div wrapping each character to fit in a CSS grid. That approach would make sense for something like a browser based code editor, but since I am mostly concerned with whether people can easily and comfortably read my content, I decided to try and find simple, readable settings. My final choice of font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.2; is pretty similar to more traditional web design.<br><br></p><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="9">9</div><p class="prose">Having read about the CSS grid, I chose to use it in moderation to add in line numbers while keeping everything aligned. Line numbers are not a super important feature, but giving each line number an id makes it very simple to link to a specific part of the article by adding that line number to the end of the URL (<a href="#9">Example</a>). THe line numbers also act well as a left margin, so I removed the CSS margins and padding. I took inspiration from text editors and made the line numbers gray to avoid distraction.<br><br></p><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="10">10</div><p class="prose">To keep things truly monospaced, I naturally gave headings the same font size as paragraphs. The color choice was much more complicated and would need an article many times longer than this one to explain, but the short reason is that I like hotpink.<br><br></p><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="11">11</div><h2 class="prose">## Looking forward<br><br></h2><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="12">12</div><p class="prose">There are many features I hope to add to this blog, and I hope that my design choices can inspire you to do some experimentation of your own. I would also really appreciate it if you, the reader, send me some inspiration in the form of feedback, whether you have design suggestions, topic suggestions, or even just a greeting to show you've read this. Your feedback is the only way I have of telling that anyone cares.<br><br></p><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="13">13</div><p class="prose">I'd especially appreciate suggestions on how to improve the accessibility of this website. I don't have much experience designing specifically for accessibility, so my experimental approach might be inaccessible in ways I haven't anticipated.<br><br></p><div class="line-number" aria-hidden="true" id="14">14</div><p class="prose">This article was edited down from its original length of over 1000 words, so I have no shortage of topics I'd like to write about in depth. I'm just not sure what people would be interested in reading about, and I'm not sure how much I should talk about silly subjects like the fact I doubled each style-rule in the CSS file to go from an ominous 444 bytes to an auspicious 888 bytes, or my reasoning behind adding the creature I call the faff serpent. It's still somewhat long, though, so thanks for reading. I hope you'll stick around and read more articles I write in the future.<br><br></p>
